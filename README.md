# My Beloved Friend | | A happy memorial for your dog project

I have a great love for Jack (my best friend), he has been with me for 7 years and now that he is an old man I have started to worry about his death, I love him and every day that he is with me I celebrate it, I try to spend a lot of time with him, playing and cuddling him as he deserves.

this project is for when he is gone, but also for all the other companions, friends, guides and 4 legged heroes.
